## My process

I measured in Photoshop the sizes, paddings, etc. Then, in VS Code I used SASS to build the styles and wrote with mobile first.
I created 2 classes for the border-radius with ":fisrt-child" and ":last-child", so you can delete or insert other types of vehicles and donÂ´t need to ajust the border-radius.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
